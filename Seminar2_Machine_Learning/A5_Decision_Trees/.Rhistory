The model numerically does very well, with an accuracy of `r round(mush_cm$overall[1], 3)`. However, a little less than 3 percent of the time, the model classifies a poisonous mushroom as being edible. I eat a lot of mushrooms, so 3 percent, while not being very large statistically, is a little too high for my taste. This is only a single test-train set, too, so repeated cross validation might reduce that value and leave me a little more confident in the model. Moreover, th
